            Conversations about the cryptocurrency market have been going on almost since the dawn of the existence of the first cryptocurrency — Bitcoin.
            Many still cannot understand what the huge growth of this sphere is based on.
            To understand this, you need to study at least a little the development of the history of the cryptocurrency market:
            The first significant successes. 2013-2014, the period when the Bitcoin exchange rate was unstable, but drew attention to itself by falling,
            then growing tens or even hundreds of times.
            China played a huge role in this, where for the first time it was possible to pay with cryptocurrency for the products of a number of official manufacturers,
            which provoked an even greater local growth of the exchange rate in this state;
            Relative market stabilization. 2015-2016, there was a slow price increase based on the fact that “digital gold” proved its viability;
            The rapid rise and heyday of altcoins in 2017. The period when cryptocurrencies were really talked about.
            There was a huge success and growth of the Bitcoin exchange rate,
            which provoked the appearance of other cryptocurrencies in mass quantities.
            As well as the growth of those altcoins that appeared even earlier, among which were the current pursuers of digital gold: Ethereum, Litecoin, Ripple and others;
            Gradual legalization and rollback of the market in 2018. Governments of countries could no longer ignore cryptocurrencies.
            They began to create draft laws to regulate the market or at least partially influence its processes;
            New growth in 2020-2021 and up to the present time. Top cryptocurrencies not only returned to the highs of 2017, but also exceeded them by two or three or more times.
            An increasing part of the community believes in the success of coins and if they are not engaged in trading, then they invest in long-term holding or mining.
            The history of the cryptocurrency market is not impressive in its stability, and sometimes it frankly “fell into the abyss.”
            But, as time has shown, those who have always and steadily believed in the success of Bitcoin and top altcoins turned out to be right and multiplied their fortune at times.
